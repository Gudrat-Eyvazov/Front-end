        <h2> Responsive Layouts Without Bootstrap</h2>
        <p class="metn1">This is a simple demonstration of organizing different elements without bootstrap so that when
            a browser is resized the elements adjust accordingly. The goal is obviously to be completely functional with
            as simple coding as possible. This means avoiding media queries when possible etc. Maybe this is common
            knowledge for most but as I'm growing and learning, I haven't found a comprehensive tutorial on the web with
            this stuff. SO here's my two cents.</p>
        <h3>Working With Inline Block</h3>
        <p class="metn2">Let's say you have a group of objects that are all similar in size and shape. A common scenario
            would be if you had multiple images or icons that you are setting side by side in a row. In our case, we'll
            use boxes. The easiest set-up is to set them in a parent container with text-align: center, to center them
            and then give each element a display:inline or inline-block, FYI, you do have to declare a width in order
            for this to work. Just keeping it real.</p>
